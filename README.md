# Seasonal Tick Sales Analysis

This study analyzes the impact of climatic variablesâ€”such as average temperature, average humidity, and dry daysâ€”on the sales of oral ectoparasitic medications in TrÃªs Lagoas during 2024. The aim is to identify seasonal patterns and correlations, ultimately optimizing inventory and marketing strategies for the company.

## Main Research Question
### How does climate influence tick-repellent sales?

## Hypotheses
- ðŸ“Œ **Sales increase** in spring and summer due to warmer, more humid weather conditions.
- ðŸ“Œ **Sales decrease** in autumn and winter when ticks are less active due to cooler, drier conditions.
- ðŸ“Œ **Regions with stable temperatures** throughout the year exhibit little variation in sales.
- ðŸ“Œ **Promotions and educational campaigns** can help boost sales during low-demand periods.

## Methodology
Data for this study were sourced from the following:
- **Climate data** (temperature, humidity, and dry days) from [CEMTEC-MS](https://www.cemtec.ms.gov.br/bancodedados/2024-2/).
- **Sales data** from **Report 338 - Sales Movement by Product**.

The analysis was conducted using **Microsoft Excel**, applying correlation calculations and scatter plots to identify patterns and trends.

## Results and Analysis

### 1. Correlation Between Sales and Average Temperature
- **Correlation coefficient**: 0.32 (weak positive correlation).
- **Findings**: There is a slight positive relationship between temperature and sales, indicating a small increase in demand during warmer months. However, temperature alone is not a decisive factor in sales volume.

### 2. Correlation Between Sales and Average Humidity
- **Correlation coefficient**: 0.63 (moderate to strong correlation).
- **Findings**: Higher humidity levels correlate with increased tick-repellent sales. This makes sense, as ticks thrive in warm, humid conditions, driving demand for control products.

### 3. Correlation Between Sales and Dry Days
- **Correlation coefficient**: -0.59 (moderate negative correlation).
- **Findings**: Longer dry periods lead to lower sales, suggesting that more frequent rainfall boosts tick proliferation, thereby increasing the need for repellents.

## Recommendations for Optimization
Based on these findings, the company can take the following actions to improve sales and inventory management:

âœ… **Inventory Planning**:  
- Plan inventory ahead of high-demand periods, particularly in the spring and summer when humidity levels are higher.

âœ… **Seasonal Marketing Campaigns**:  
- Create targeted marketing campaigns in autumn and winter to maintain sales during low-demand periods. Educational content can also increase awareness of tick-related risks.

âœ… **Supplier Negotiations**:  
- Work with suppliers to secure better prices or bulk discounts during peak seasons when demand is higher.

## Conclusion
The results indicate that humidity and rainy periods have a significant impact on tick-repellent sales. Temperature, however, is not a decisive factor on its own. By optimizing inventory, marketing, and pricing strategies based on climate data, the company can improve efficiency and maximize profits throughout the year.
