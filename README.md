# seasonal-tick-sales
An exploratory analysis of the correlation between seasonality and tick-repellent sales using historical temperature and humidity data. The goal is to identify patterns and generate insights to optimize inventory and marketing strategies in the pet industry.

## Main Question:
How does the season affect tick-repellent sales?

## Hypotheses:
- Sales of tick repellents increase in summer and spring due to warm and humid weather.
- Demand decreases in autumn and winter when parasites are less active.
- Regions with more stable temperatures throughout the year do not show significant variation in sales.
- Promotions and educational campaigns during low sales periods can improve demand.

## Data used:
ðŸ“Œ Historical sales data of tick repellents (quantity sold, average ticket, seasonality)
ðŸ“Œ Temperature and humidity throughout the year
ðŸ“Œ Periods of tick outbreaks in the region (veterinary data, demand for grooming services)
ðŸ“Œ Effects of promotions and awareness campaigns

## Tools and Techniques:
- Correlation analysis to see the relationship between temperature and sales.
- Linear/multiple regression to forecast demand based on climate.
- Visualizations in Power BI or Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib) to demonstrate seasonal patterns.

## This analysis can help the company to:
âœ… Better plan inventory before high-demand periods.
âœ… Create seasonal marketing campaigns to boost sales in autumn/winter.
âœ… Negotiate with suppliers to ensure better prices during the right periods.
